The purpose of this project was to create a text adventure game that had to incorporate polyphormism. Other OOP principles
that I included was inheritance and encapsulation. The game also inculdes basic Java Swing programming for easy gameplay 
within the GUI.
The code can be found in the Final Project/fproject folder
Enjoy!
